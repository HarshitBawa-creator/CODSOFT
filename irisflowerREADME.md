# Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at CODSOFT**.

In this task, I built a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — based on sepal and petal measurements.

# Dataset

- Source: [UCI Iris Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv)
- Total Rows: 150
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
  - Species (Target)

---

# Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)
- Google Colab

---

# Steps Performed

1. Loaded and visualized the dataset
2. Explored the distribution of species
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Random Forest Classifier
5. Evaluated the model with accuracy and classification report

# Model Results

- **Accuracy:** 100% on test set (due to small and clean dataset)
- **Model:** RandomForestClassifier
