This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at CODSOFT**.

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, passenger class, and more.

# Dataset

- Source: [Titanic Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv)
- Total Rows: 891
- Features:
  - Pclass (Passenger class)
  - Sex
  - Age
  - SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
  - Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
  - Fare
  - Embarked (Port of embarkation)
  - Survived (Target: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

# Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)
- Google Colab

---

# Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset
2. Handled missing values in Age and Embarked
3. Dropped unnecessary columns (Name, Ticket, Cabin)
4. Converted categorical data to numeric
5. Trained a Random Forest Classifier
6. Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report

---

# Model Results

- **Accuracy:** ~85% (may vary on random splits)
- **Evaluation:** Precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes (0 and 1)
